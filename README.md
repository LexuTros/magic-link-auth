# Magic Auth with Next.js

## Setup of Magic API

For the Magic API to work, we need local environment variables of the magic application.<br>
Those can be set on the system or by including a `.env.local` file and adding the Magic Auth API keys.

```javascript
// .env.local - needed variables

NEXT_PUBLIC_MAGIC_PUBLISHABLE_KEY = "MAGIC AUTH PUBLISHABLE KEY"
MAGIC_SECRET_KEY = "MAGIC AUTH SECRET KEY"
```
